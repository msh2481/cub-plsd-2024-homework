# PL in SD Homework

When doing the homework:
- Make a private clone of the repository and add me
  (`jesyspa`) as a contributor.
- In the directory of the exercise, make your own
  subdirectory, with your GitHub usernames.
- Work in your private repository.  If you'd like feedback
  on something before submission, message me.
- *After* the due date, make a pull request to this
  repository.
- If your GitHub profile doesn't include your name, message
  me to let me know who you are. :)
